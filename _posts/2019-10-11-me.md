I got my Ms. C. in Computer Networks and Embedded Systems at the [University of Strasbourg](http://www.unistra.fr/index.php?id=accueil&utm_source=unistra_fr&utm_medium=unistra_fr_homepage) in 2019.  

I am now working on my Ph. D. funded by a governemental fellowship at the University of Strasbourg, in the [Networks Teams](http://icube-reseaux.unistra.fr/fr/index.php/Accueil) of the [ICube laboratory](https://icube.unistra.fr/en/). My work is on **Segment Routing, path computation and network monitoring**, and is supervised by Pr. [Cristel Pelsser](http://clarinet.u-strasbg.fr/~pelsser/) and Dr. [Pascal MÃ©rindol](http://clarinet.u-strasbg.fr/~merindol/). I am also currently (2019/2020) doing a complementary teaching activity. 


I also worked on **Internet topology discovery**, more precisely on MPLS tunnels revelation in the wild ([paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8784525),  [code](https://github.com/JroLuttringer/TraceTunnel)), on **large-scale multi-domain tunnels measurements** ([Geant GN4](https://wiki.geant.org/display/gn42jra2/JRA2T4+testbed)), and on **OPTIC, an efficient 
BGP protection scheme** that aims at effectively and optimaly protect transiting traffic from intra-domain failures ([master's thesis](http://icube-reseaux.unistra.fr/en/images//7/7e/Optic.pdf), [slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1H9kAwomsVXpHlAsIausWVZ4WzSj3JpF9)).   


As you may have guessed, my main research interests are:
* Routing and path computation 
* Network measurement and monitoring 
* Topology discovery
