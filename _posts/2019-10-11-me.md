I got my Ms. C. in Computer Networks and Embedded Systems at the [University of Strasbourg](http://www.unistra.fr/index.php?id=accueil&utm_source=unistra_fr&utm_medium=unistra_fr_homepage) in 2019.  

I am now working on my Ph. D., still at the University of Strasbourg, in the [Networks Teams](http://icube-reseaux.unistra.fr/fr/index.php/Accueil) of the [ICube laboratory](https://icube.unistra.fr/en/). My work is on Segment Routing, path computation and network monitoring, and is supervised by Cristel Pelsser and Pascal MÃ©rindol.  


I also worked on Internet topology discovery (MPLS tunnels revelation, [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8784525)), large-scale network measurements, and on an efficient 
BGP protection scheme that aims at mitigating the effects of intra-domain failures on transiting traffic ([master's thesis](http://icube-reseaux.unistra.fr/en/images//7/7e/Optic.pdf)).   


As you may have guessed, my main research interests are:
* Routing and path computation 
* Network measurement and monitoring 
* Topology discovery
